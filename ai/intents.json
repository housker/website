          "Message": "This is such an open-ended question, I think it could apply to so many areas. One kind of funny, kind of tenacious example would be the method with which I managed to afford living in Boston while making minimum wage, having no friends or relatives east of the Mississippi. I pared down my worldly belongings enough to fit them all in a carry on, and then met up with my Craigslist roommate in North End who definitively confirmed a mere three days before my flight that he would in fact not be withdrawing his offer to give me a room. What was to follow was a lifestyle hack that depended on minimalism, social networking, heavy use of forums and Craigslist, an intimate knowledge of public transit routes, and a functional degree of upper body strength. After a visit from the fire department on account of the other roommate microwaving a potato until it was a plume of smoke, I proceeded to enter into a succession of sublets, devising what by the end of that year had become a well-practiced technique of moving via public transportation, completed in two trips on the T, and done by noon in time to take up a closing shift. My social circle by that point had expanded enough to clue me in on better options, and I was lucky enough to be the proud recipient of a legally binding lease by New Year's. Having come from a town of 500 people in the public transit desert of the Midwest, discovering these little oases conducive of my gritty self-reliance in the midst of unattainable $1,000+ rent apartments, each one felt like the kind of narrow escape I'd only previously read about.",
